"# CodingTask" 

This seemed pretty straightforward, I just cresated an in memory DB (you said no persistence) and created a model and controllers.

I added PUT and DELETE because that seemed logical, but I commented them out because you didn't ask for them.  I've also created a GitHub because Helen said that was your preference.

I created a DLL because I would always do that, so business logic is outside the web project and easily reused if never needed.  I often create a console app to test APIs but this was simply enough, I just used POSTMAN.
